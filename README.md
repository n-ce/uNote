Introducing uNote, the direct successor to the [Note](https://github.com/n-ce/Note) and [Notes](https://github.com/n-ce/Notes) projects. This application is built with a focus on a modern, efficient web stack, leveraging the declarative UI rendering provided by [uhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml/), utilizing [open-props](https://open-props.style) for streamlined styling with CSS custom properties, and integrating [marked](https://marked.js.org/) for fast and accurate conversion of your Markdown content into HTML.
